# DAY-3
     Programs list:-
                    1)Conversion of a given number from decimal to binary.
                    2)Factors of a number
                    3)Happy number.(Meaning:- A number is said to be happy if it yields 1 when replaced
                                              by the sum of squares of its digits repeatedly.
                                              If this process results in an endless cycle of numbers 
                                              containing 4, then the number will be an unhappy number.) 
                        Ex:-
                             1) Number=32
                                    3 ^2 + 2 ^2 = 13
                                    1 ^2 + 3 ^2 = 10
                                    1 ^2 + 0 ^2 = 1
                                Therefore, 32 is a happy number.
                             
                            2) Number=82
                                    8 ^2 + 2 ^2 = 68
                                    6 ^2 + 8 ^2 = 100
                                    1 ^2 + 0 ^2 + 0 ^2 = 1
                               Therefore, 82 is a happy number.
                    
                    4)Prime factors of a number.
                    5)Pronic number.(Meaning:- A number is said to be pronic if it is a product of 
                                               2 consecutive numbers.)
                        Ex:- 1) 6 = 2 X 3
                             2) 20 = 4 X 5

                     3)Splitting a string at blank spaces.
# DAY-6
      Programs list:-
                     1)To check if two given strings are anagram of each other.
                       (Anagram definition:- An anagram is a word or phrase formed by 
                                             rearranging the letters of a different
                                             word or phrase, typically using all the 
                                             original letters exactly once.) 
                        Ex:- 1)Race = care.
                        
                             2)Eleven plus two = Twelve plus one.   
                      2)Reversing a string.
